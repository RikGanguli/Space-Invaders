# Space Invaders - Pygame

Welcome to **Space Invaders**, a classic arcade-style shooting game developed using Python's Pygame library. The player controls a spaceship and must shoot down waves of alien UFOs while avoiding enemy bullets and crashes. Keep track of your score as you progress, but be careful â€” if an enemy bullet hits you or you crash into a UFO, the game is over!
